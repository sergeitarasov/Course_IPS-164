## Software to Install

* [jalview](https://www.jalview.org)
* [mafft](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) (there is also an online version that can be used without installation)
* [IQ Tree](http://www.iqtree.org)
* [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)


Tree inference with molecular data includes the following steps:

1. Getting orthologous sequences
2. Alignment
3. Model selection
4. Tree inference


## 1. Getting orthologous sequences

Go to *Analyses* folder. It includes three unaligned fasta files which are mitochondrial genes (COI, COII, 16s) of 10 dung beetle species from the tribe Oniticellini. We assume that sequences within each file are orthologous.

## 2. Alignment

We will use mafft for aligning sequences. Mafft is the powerful software that includes many different algorithms. For this demo, we will use the default settings of mafft to quickly align the sequences. If you do not have mafft installed locally use the [online version](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) 


```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mafft --auto Oniticel_COI.fasta > aligned_Oniticel_COI.fasta 
mafft --auto Oniticel_COII.fasta > aligned_Oniticel_COII.fasta 
mafft --auto Oniticel_rRNA_16S.fasta > aligned_Oniticel_rRNA_16S.fasta
```

Open aligned fasta files with Jalview.

## 3&4. Model selection & Tree inference
Now, we are ready to run tree inference with iqtree. For Windows users: copy the two files form the iqtree *\bin* folder to our  *Analysis* folder; using command line tool cmd navigate to *Analysis* folder by typing *cd "D:\YOUR_PATH\Analysis"*. Now you can iqtree from within the command line. More help is [here](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Quickstart).

Let's run the simplest analysis that treats the three genes as separate partitions and assigns to each GTR+G model.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
iqtree -spp partition_1.txt -bb 1000 -pre part_simple
```

* -spp specifies partition file partition_1.tx
* -bb an ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) (Minh et al., 2013; Hoang et al., 2018) with 1000 replicates
* -pre prefix for output files

Use FigTree to view the tree fiels.

Now Let's complicate our analysis by using a more complex partitioning scheme + partitioning and model selection.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
iqtree -spp partition_1.txt -m TESTMERGE -rcluster 10 -bb 1000 -pre part_Best
```

* -m Perform standard model selection like; -m TESTMERGE select best-fit partitioning scheme by possibly merging partitions to reduce over-parameterization and increase model fit. It implements the greedy algorithm of PartitionFinder. After the selection perform tree search.
* -rcluster 10 Specify the percentage for the relaxed clustering algorithm (Lanfear et al., 2014) to speed up the computation instead of the default slow greedy algorithm. This is similar to --rcluster-percent option of PartitionFinder. For example, with -rcluster 10 only the top 10% partition schemes are considered to save computations.

# Additonal Info

* Install [Beast2](https://www.beast2.org) and [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) for tomorrow's demo

* There is an additional tutorial *Correlated_trait_evo.R* for testing correlated trait evolution in the folder *Additional_tutorials*
